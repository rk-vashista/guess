Project Requirements Document: GestureBind – Gesture-Based Shortcut Mapper
The following table outlines the detailed functional requirements for the GestureBind application.

Requirement ID	Description	User Story	Expected Behavior/Outcome
FR001	Real-time Gesture Detection	As a user, I want my camera to detect my hand or body gestures in real time so I can trigger actions quickly.	The system should access the webcam, identify gestures continuously using the selected model (MediaPipe, YOLO, etc.), and display live feedback.
FR002	Predefined Gesture Recognition	As a user, I want the system to recognize common gestures out-of-the-box so I can use it immediately.	The system should detect gestures like fist, open palm, peace sign, etc., without requiring training.
FR003	Custom Gesture Training	As a user, I want to train the system with my own gestures so I can personalize how actions are triggered.	The system should provide a “training mode” where users record new gestures and assign labels.
FR004	Gesture-to-Action Mapping	As a user, I want to map each gesture to a custom action so I can control my system hands-free.	A UI should allow users to associate a gesture with predefined or user-defined actions.
FR005	Triggering System Actions	As a user, I want gestures to launch applications or execute keybindings so I can automate tasks.	Once a gesture is detected, the mapped action (e.g., open Spotify, mute mic) is triggered instantly via OS integration tools.
FR006	OS-Level Integration	As a user, I want the app to simulate keyboard presses or mouse clicks so I can replicate shortcut behavior.	The system should simulate inputs using libraries like pynput, keyboard, or pyautogui.
FR007	Action Feedback Overlay	As a user, I want to see feedback when a gesture is recognized so I know the system has responded.	A small overlay window or on-screen display should appear with gesture/action name confirmation.
FR008	Adjustable Detection Sensitivity	As a user, I want to adjust how strict gesture recognition is so I can reduce false positives.	Users should be able to tune detection confidence thresholds and cooldown intervals between gesture triggers.
FR009	Background/Tray Mode	As a user, I want the app to run in the background so I can use gesture shortcuts without reopening the app.	The app should have a minimized/tray mode and optionally launch at startup.
FR010	Settings Persistence	As a user, I want my gesture mappings and settings to persist across sessions so I don’t have to reconfigure them.	All user data should be saved locally in a JSON/YAML/config file and loaded automatically at startup.
FR011	Cross-Platform Support	As a user, I want to use the app on any OS (Windows, Linux, macOS) so it fits into my environment.	The app should be developed using portable libraries, with platform-specific adjustments for compatibility.
FR012	Security and Privacy	As a user, I want all processing to happen locally so that my camera data stays private.	No video or gesture data should be uploaded externally. All models and inference should run on-device.
FR013	Built-in Profiles/Presets	As a user, I want to load gesture sets for apps like PowerPoint or Zoom so I can get started quickly.	The system should ship with gesture presets for common applications, which users can modify or extend.
FR014	Export/Import Configuration	As a user, I want to export and import my gesture setups so I can transfer or share them.	Users should be able to export gesture mappings and settings into a file and re-import them later.
FR015	Pause and Resume Detection	As a user, I want to pause detection when needed so it doesn’t accidentally trigger commands.	A toggle button or hotkey should allow pausing and resuming gesture detection easily.
